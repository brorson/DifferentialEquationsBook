This is a textbooklet on solving IVPs with numerical methods.  The
target audience is advanced undergrads and masters students. It is
meant as a set of course notes for MATH 7205, Numerical Analysis 2
taught at Northeastern every fall.

The booklet covers basic Euler solvers, Runge-Kutta, and linear
multistep methods.  It discusses explicit vs. implicit methds.  It
discusses stability and the stability domains of some of the methods.
It talks about adaptive methods and the concept of stiffness.
Finally, it ends up with a chapter on symplectic methods and why they
are important.

Beyond the solver algorithms, the book includes many example ODEs and
shows their solutions using the methods discussed.  

Accompanying the book are Matlab programs which implement the methods
described in the text.  Many figures in the text were produced using
the Matlab programs.
