This demonstrates the use of the trapezoidal method to integrate the simple
linear ODE y' = alpha*y.  There are two things to run:

1.  test_trapezoidal -- Run trapezoidal for different values
of alpha and plot the results.  It also plots the analytic result
for comparison.

2.  test_trapezoidal_h -- Runs trapezoidal for constant alpha
but varying stepsize h.  It plots the result and also plots the RMS
error vs. stepsize h.  The goal of this program is to show the scaling
of error with stepsize.

Note that the trapezoidal method is an implicit method so it uses
fsolve() as the solver.
