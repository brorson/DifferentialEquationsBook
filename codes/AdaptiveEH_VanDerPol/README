This integrates the Van Der Pol oscillator equations using my
poor-man's adaptive solver.  It compares the results from a forward
Euler step to the results from a Heun's method step, and then adjusts
the step size based on how much the two results differ.

There are two things to run:

test_adaptive_eh:  This computes the solution for one value of
epsilon.

make_phase_plots:  This computes the family of solutions obtained when
epsilon is varied.  This is used to illustrate stiffness of the ODE --
where many different trajectories closely approach each other in phase
space.
