This directory holds functions which make phase space plots showing
the evolution of a small area with increasing time.  Both foward Euler
and symplectic Euler are demonstrated.  The things to run are:

phase_space_semi_implicit_euler.m -- Symplectic Euler
phase_space_fwd_euler.m           -- Forward Euler

The thing to note is that the initial square does not change area
under symplectic Euler, but grows with increasing time under forward
Euler.
