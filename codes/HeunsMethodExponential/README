This demonstrates the use of Heun's method to integrate the simple
linear ODE y' = alpha*y.  There are two things to run:

1.  test_heun -- Run heun for different values
of alpha and plot the results.  It also plots the analytic result
for comparison.

2.  test_heun_h -- Runs heun for constant alpha
but varying stepsize h.  It plots the result and also plots the RMS
error vs. stepsize h.  The goal of this program is to show the scaling
of error with stepsize.
