This code computes the solution to the Van Der Pol equation using
third-order Adams-Moulton.  The thing to run is
test_adams_moulton3.

Note that Adams-Moulton needs a simpler method to start up.
Therefore, I used RK4 to compute the first two points, then all
subsequent steps are taken by 3rd order Adams-Moulton.
