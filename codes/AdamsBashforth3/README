This demonstrates the use of AB3 to integrate the simple
linear ODE y' = alpha*y.  There are two things to run:

1.  test_adams_bashforth3 -- Run adams_bashforth3 for different values
of alpha and plots the results.  It also plots the analytic result
for comparison.

2.  test_adams_bashforth3_h -- Runs adams_bashforth3 for constant alpha
but varying stepsize h.  It plots the result and also plots the RMS
error vs. stepsize h.  The goal is to show how the error scales with
h.
