This demonstrates the use of forward Euler to integrate the simple
linear ODE.  There are two things to run:

1.  test_forward_euler -- Run forward_euler for different values
of alpha and plots the results.  It also plots the analytic result
for comparison.

2.  test_forward_euler_h -- Runs forward_euler for constant alpha
but varying stepsize h.  It plots the result and also plots the RMS
error vs. stepsize h.  The thing to note is that the RMS error scales
as O(h).
