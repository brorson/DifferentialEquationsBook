This integrates the simple linear ODE y' = alpha*y using 4th order
Runge Kutta.

There are two things to run:

1.  test_RK4 -- Run RK4 for different values
of alpha and plots the results.  It also plots the analytic result
for comparison.

2.  test_RK4_h -- Runs RK4 for constant alpha
but varying stepsize h.  It plots the result and also plots the RMS
error vs. stepsize h.
